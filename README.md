Description:

This Python script utilizes the OpenCV (cv2) and MediaPipe libraries to classify hand gestures shown to a 
computer's camera in real time. Specifically, it is designed to recognize and classify Asamyuta Hastas or Mudras, 
which are traditional hand gestures used in Indian classical dance and rituals.

The script processes video input from the camera, identifies hand landmarks, and uses conditional statements 
to classify the mudras accurately. It provides a user-friendly interface to visualize the hand gestures
in real-time and track their classifications.
